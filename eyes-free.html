Once enabled, you can activate on-screen controls, launch installed applications, and trigger other commonly used Android actions using spoken commands. </p></div> <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-1'><h3 id='sec-1-1'><span class='section-number-3'>1.1</span> Enabling <b>Just Speak</b></h3><div id='text-1-1' class='outline-text-3'><p>Once installed, you can enable the <b>Just Speak</b> service under <i>Settings-&gt;Accessibility</i> on your Android device. Enabling the service is an action that only needs to be performed once as <b>Just Speak</b> will be automatically restarted when the phone is rebooted. </p> <p><b>Just Speak</b> is an Accessibility Service that uses Acessibility APIs on the platform to augment Android's user interface. <b>Just Speak</b> augments the Android user interface with voice-input control; other Accessibility Services like TalkBack provide spoken feedback. Note that <b>Just Speak</b> can be used either by itself, or in conjunction with other platform Accessibility Services such as TalkBack. </p></div></div><div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-2'><h3 id='sec-1-2'><span class='section-number-3'>1.2</span> Initiating Voice Recognition</h3><div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'><p>Once <b>Just Speak</b> is installed and enabled on your device, you can initiate voice commands by either performing an up-swipe from the Home button (if your device has soft keys) or by performing multiple taps on the Home button (if your device has hard keys). Note that this is the same gesture that activates Google Now on devices running the stock version of Android; When using <b>Just Speak</b> , you can get to Google Now by saying <i>Launch Google Now</i>. </p> <p>Successful invocation of <b>Just Speak</b> starts voice recognition; this is indicated by playing an auditory icon (accompanied by vibration if available) and a visual overlay. Depending on the settings enabled in <b>Just Speak</b>, as well as other Accessibility Services, received voice input may be spoken and/or displayed after voice recognition has completed. As an example, TalkBack can work in conjunction with <b>Just Speak</b> to speak the recognized commands. <b>Just Speak</b> supports both <i>local</i> and <i>global</i>commands as described in later sections of this document. </p></div></div><div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-3'><h3 id='sec-1-3'><span class='section-number-3'>1.3</span> Cancelling Voice Recognition</h3><div id='text-1-3' class='outline-text-3'><p>Voice recognition can be stopped by performing the same action used to initiate voice recognition (either performing an up-swipe from the Home button or by performing multiple clicks of the Home button). <b>Just Speak</b> is also programmed to stop listening if no voice input is received after a specific amount of time. Finally, an overlay, that covers the entire screen, is displayed whenever voice recognition is active; Clicking anywhere on this overlay will dismiss the overlay and terminate voice recognition. </p></div></div><div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-4'><h3 id='sec-1-4'><span class='section-number-3'>1.4</span> Global Voice Commands</h3><div id='text-1-4' class='outline-text-3'><p>Just Speak supports a set of global commands that are available on any screen. These global commands include: </p> <table frame='hsides' rules='groups' cellpadding='6' cellspacing='0' border='2'>  <colgroup><col class='left'/> <col class='left'/> <col class='left'/> <col class='left'/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class='left'>Command        </td><td class='left'>Utterance                    </td><td class='left'>Synonym</td><td class='left'>Action                        </td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Open           </td><td class='left'>Open &lt;Installed Application&gt;</td><td class='left'>Launch, Run</td><td class='left'>Launch Application            </td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Recent         </td><td class='left'>Recent Apps                       </td><td class='left'>Recent Applications</td><td class='left'>Recent Applications           </td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Quick Settings</td><td class='left'>Quick Settings               </td><td class='left'>Open</td><td class='left'>Quick Settings         </td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Toggle WiFi</td><td class='left'>Switch WiFi (On/Off)</td><td class='left'> </td><td class='left'>Toggle WiFi</td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Toggle Bluetooth</td><td class='left'>Switch Bluetooth (On/Off)</td><td class='left'> </td><td class='left'>Toggle Bluetooth</td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Toggle Tethering</td><td class='left'>Switch Tethering (On/Off)</td><td class='left'> </td><td class='left'>Toggle Tethering</td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Home           </td><td class='left'>Go Home                      </td><td class='left'> </td><td class='left'>Return to home screen         </td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Back           </td><td class='left'>Go Back                      </td><td class='left'> </td><td class='left'>Return to previous screen     </td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Notifications  </td><td class='left'>Open Notifications           </td><td class='left'> </td><td class='left'>Open notifications shade</td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Easy Labels</td><td class='left'>Easy Labels</td><td class='left'> </td><td class='left'>Display Easy Labels</td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Note that voice commands are flexible in that action words may be substituted with synonymous verbs (eg: “launch” in place of “open”). In addition, voice commands can be formulated as complete sentences, e.g., "Please open GMail". </p> <p>In addition, <b>Just Speak</b> provides the following spoken aliases as a means of triggering commonly used applications: </p> <table frame='hsides' rules='groups' cellpadding='6' cellspacing='0' border='2'>  <colgroup><col class='left'/> <col class='left'/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class='left'>Utterance     </td><td class='left'>Action                     </td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Browser       </td><td class='left'>Launch default Web browser</td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Web           </td><td class='left'>Launch default Web Browser</td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>OK Google Now</td><td class='left'>Launch Google Now          </td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Search        </td><td class='left'>Launch Voice Search        </td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Voice Search  </td><td class='left'>Launch Voice Search        </td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-5'><h3 id='sec-1-5'><span class='section-number-3'>1.5</span> Local Voice Commands</h3><div id='text-1-5' class='outline-text-3'><p>In addition to the global commands that are available all screens, <b>Just Speak</b> allows you to interact with on-screen controls in a variety of ways. </p> <table frame='hsides' rules='groups' cellpadding='6' cellspacing='0' border='2'>  <colgroup><col class='left'/> <col class='left'/> <col class='left'/> <col class='left'/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class='left'>Command  </td><td class='left'>Utterance            </td><td class='left'>Synonym</td><td class='left'>Action                                 </td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Activate</td><td class='left'>Click &lt;control name&gt;</td><td class='left'>Click, Tap</td><td class='left'>Activate control by its on-screen name</td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Scroll   </td><td class='left'>Scroll Up/Down       </td><td class='left'>Forward, Backward</td><td class='left'>Scroll  e.g., Lists.                   </td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Switch</td><td class='left'> </td><td class='left'>Switch On/Off Toggle</td><td class='left'>Toggle Switches</td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Long Press</td><td class='left'>Long Press</td><td class='left'>Long Click, Long Tap</td><td class='left'>Long Press on on-screen controls</td></tr> <tr><td class='left'>Check</td><td class='left'>Check  </td><td class='left'>Check, Uncheck</td><td class='left'>Toggle CheckBox values</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-6'><h3 id='sec-1-6'><span class='section-number-3'>1.6</span> Labeling On-Screen Control</h3><div id='text-1-6' class='outline-text-3'><p>When using <b>Just Speak</b>, the text labels that appear next to on-screen controls determine the set of available local commands. For many controls, such as images, checkboxes, and switches, there may be no visible text to associate with the control. In these instances, <b>Just Speak</b> uses underlying Accessibility Metadata provided by the application developer to construct relevant labels; note that this metadata is also used by Accessibility Services such as TalkBack to meaningfully speak on-screen controls. </p> <p>We leverage the visual overlay that indicates that <b>Just Speak</b>is active to visually display this additional metadata — this serves as a hint as to what you can say to activate the available controls. These overlay labels take one of two forms: </p> <ol class='org-ol'><li>Controls receives a centered label in the simple case </li></ol><p>where there are no actionable child controls that need additional labeling. </p><ol class='org-ol'><li>Where the control itself has actionable children, </li></ol><p><b>Just Speak</b> displays a labled frame around the actionable children. </p></div></div><div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-7'><h3 id='sec-1-7'><span class='section-number-3'>1.7</span> Chaining Commands</h3><div id='text-1-7' class='outline-text-3'><p><b>Just Speak</b> can be configured to take multiple voice commands at once and perform them sequentially. This chaining works with both local and global commands, performing the preceding action after the previous action has been executed. Commands are chained via simple connectives such as “and” and “then”. An example of this would be </p> <pre class='example'><br />“Click confirm and then go home”.<br /></pre> <p>In this case, <b>Just Speak</b> would click the “Confirm” control (assuming it’s present) and upon completion of that task, return to the Home screen. </p></div></div><div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-8'><h3 id='sec-1-8'><span class='section-number-3'>1.8</span> Easy Labels</h3><div id='text-1-8' class='outline-text-3'><p>Another configurable setting in <b>Just Speak</b> is the ability to replace the labels associated with on-screen controls with <i>easy labels</i>. These are phonetic labels that are designed to be unambiguous and are displayed in the overlay over their respective controls, easily identifying what to say to interact with a specific control. Note that <i>phonetic labels</i> can be temporarily activated or deactivated via the <b>Just Speak</b> global command <i>Easy Labels</i>. </p></div></div><div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-9'><h3 id='sec-1-9'><span class='section-number-3'>1.9</span> Persistent Overlay</h3><div id='text-1-9' class='outline-text-3'><p>To aid users with limited dexterity, <b>Just Speak</b> also provides the option to make the overlay persistent, capturing all touch events received by the Android device. This effectively removes all traditional interactions a user can have with their device, replacing it with <b>Just Speak</b> functionality. The benefit of this is that the entire device essentially becomes a button, toggling between initiating and terminating voice recognition. In addition to this, overlay labeling is always present, allowing you to constantly be aware of what you can say to <b>Just Speak</b>. </p></div></div><div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-10'><h3 id='sec-1-10'><span class='section-number-3'>1.10</span> Alternative Means Of Initiating Voice Recognition</h3><div id='text-1-10' class='outline-text-3'><p>We are continuing to experiment with alternative ways of initiating voice recognition. Toward this end, <b>Just Speak</b> enables you to configure an NFC tag that can then be tapped to initiate voice control; see “Just Speak -&gt; Settings” for configuring an NFC tag. </p></div></div></div></div><div class='status' id='postamble'><p class='date'>Date:      2013-08-06 Tue</p><p class='author'>Author:    T.V Raman</p><p class='date'>Created: 2013-12-18 Wed 13:50</p><p class='creator'><a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/'>Emacs</a> 24.3.50.1 (<a href='http://orgmode.org'>Org</a> mode 8.2.3a)</p><p class='validation'><a href='http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer'>Validate</a></p></div>     </div>  </div>

It gives a conceptual overview of the 16 possible gestures and describes how they are used. The interaction behavior described here holds for all aspects of the Android user interface, including interactive Web pages within  Chrome and the Android Web Browser. </p>  </div> <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1-1'><h3 id='sec-1-1'><span class='section-number-3'>1.1</span> Conceptual Overview Of The  Gestures</h3><div id='text-1-1' class='outline-text-3'>   <p>Placing  a finger on the screen speaks the item under the finger by first placing Accessibility Focus on that item. Moving  the finger triggers touch exploration which moves Accessibility Focus. </p><p>To generate any of the Accessibility Gestures discussed below, one moves the finger <i>much faster</i> — how much faster is something we will tune over time, and if needed, make user customizable. </p><p>To remember the gestures, think of the four directions, <i>Up</i>, <i>Down</i>, <i>Left</i> and <i>Right</i>. In addition to these four basic navigational gestures, we defined an additional 12 gestures by picking pairwise combinations of these directional flicks, e.g., <i>Left then Down</i> — this gives a total of 16 possible gestures. In what follows, <i>left then down</i> means swipe left, and continue with a down flick. Note that in performing these additional gestures, speed matters the most. As an example, it is not essential that you make a perfect <i>Capital L</i> when performing the <i>Down then Right</i> gesture for instance; speed throughout the gesture, as well as ensuring that the finger moves some distance in each direction is key to avoid these being misinterpreted as basic navigational gestures. </p></div> </div> <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1-2'><h3 id='sec-1-2'><span class='section-number-3'>1.2</span> Accessibility Focus And Accessibility Gestures</h3><div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>  <p>Accessibility Focus is moved using the four basic directional gestures. For now we have aliased <i>Left</i> with <i>Up</i>, and <i>Down</i>with <i>Right</i>; i.e., both <i>Left</i> and <i>Up</i> move to the previous item, whereas <i>Down</i> and <i>Right</i> move to the next item. Note that this is <i>not</i> the same as moving with a physical D-Pad or keyboard on Android; the Android platform moves System Focus in response to the D-Pad. Thus, moving with a D-Pad or trackball moves you through the various interactive controls on the screen; moving Accessibility Focus via the Accessibility Gestures moves you through <i>everything</i> on the screen. </p></div> </div> <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1-3'><h3 id='sec-1-3'><span class='section-number-3'>1.3</span> Accessibility Gestures For Common Actions</h3><div id='text-1-3' class='outline-text-3'>  <p>In addition to the basic navigation describe above, we define the following gestures for common actions: </p><dl><dt>Navigation Granularity</dt><dd>You can increase or decrease        navigation granularity by rapidly stroking <i>Up then Down</i> or <i>Down then Up</i>. </dd><dt>Scrolling  Lists</dt><dd>You can scroll a list forward  by        rapidly stroking <i>Right then Left</i>; the reverse, i.e.,        <i>Left then Right</i> scrolls the list backward by a screenful. </dd></dl>  </div> </div> <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1-4'><h3 id='sec-1-4'><span class='section-number-3'>1.4</span> User Configurable Gestures</h3><div id='text-1-4' class='outline-text-3'>   <p> Gestures <i>Down then Left</i>, <i>Up then Left</i>, <i>Down then Right</i> and <i>Up then Right</i>are user configurable; their default assignments are shown below. </p><dl><dt>Back</dt><dd>Gesture <i>Down then Left</i> is the same as pressing the             <i>Back</i> button. </dd><dt>Home</dt><dd><i>Up then Left</i> has the same effect as pressing the <i>Home</i>            button. </dd><dt>Status Bar</dt><dd>Gesture <i>Up then Right</i> opens Status Notifications. </dd><dt>Recent </dt><dd><i>Down then Right</i> has the same effect as pressing the <i>Recent Applications</i> button. </dd></dl> </div> </div> <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1-5'><h3 id='sec-1-5'><span class='section-number-3'>1.5</span> Summary</h3><div id='text-1-5' class='outline-text-3'>  <p>Gestures for manipulating and working with Accessibility Focus are an evolving part of the Android Accessibility; we will continue to refine these based on user experience.

This article gives a  user-centric overview of the Jelly Bean interaction model as  enabled by touch exploration and navigational gestures. Note that  as with every release, Android Accesssibility continues to  evolve, and so as before, what we have today is by no means the  final word.  </p>    </div>    <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1-1'>  <h3 id='sec-1-1'><span class='section-number-3'>1.1</span> High-Level Concepts</h3>  <div id='text-1-1' class='outline-text-3'>        <p>  First, here's some shared vocabulary to ensure that we're all  talking of the same thing  when explaining Jelly Bean access:  </p>  <dl>  <dt>Random Access</dt><dd>Enable user to reach any part of the                        on-screen UI with equal ease. We enabled                        this as of ICS  with touch exploration.  </dd>  <dt>Deterministic Access </dt><dd>Enable user to reliably land on a         desired item on the screen. We enable this in Jelly Bean         with <i>linear navigation</i>.  </dd>  <dt>Accessibility Focus</dt><dd>The item that  the user most recently         interacted with  — either via touch exploaration or         linear navigation receives <i>accessibility focus</i>.  </dd>  <dt>Activation</dt><dd>User can activate item having <i>accessibility                   focus</i> by double-tapping <b>anywhere</b> on the                    screen.  </dd>  </dl>      </div>    </div>    <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1-2'>  <h3 id='sec-1-2'><span class='section-number-3'>1.2</span> Sample Interaction Scenarios We Enable</h3>  <div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>      <p>  The combination of random access via touch exploration, backed up  by linear navigation starting from the point the user just  explored enables users to:  </p>  <ul>  <li>Touch explore an application to understand its screen layout,  </li>  <li>Use muscle memory to quickly touch parts of the display to      access familiar application screens,  </li>  <li>Use linear navigation to reach the desired item when muscle      memory is wrong by a small amount.  </li>  </ul>      <p>  As an example, when using the Google Play Store, I can use muscle  memory with touch exploration to find the <i>Search</i> button in the  top action bar. Having found an application to install, I can  once again use muscle memory to roughly touch in the vicinity of  the <i>Install</i> button; If what I touch is not the <i>Install</i>  button, I can typically find it with one or two linear navigation  steps. Having found the <i>Install</i> button, I can double-tap  anywhere on the screen.  </p>  <p>  The same use case in ICS where we lacked <i>Accessibility Focus</i>  and linear navigation would have forced me to use touch  exploration exclusively. In instances where muscle memory worked  perfectly, this form of interaction was highly effective; but in  our experience, it also tended to lead to breakdowns and  consequent user frustration in instances where users almost found  the control they were looking for but missed by a small amount.  </p>  <p>  Having introduced accessibility focus and linear navigation in  Jelly Bean, we decided to eliminate the ICS requirement that the  user tap on or near a control to activate it  — we now enable  users to activate the item with accessibility focus by tapping  <b>anywhere</b> on the screen. To eliminate spurious taps ---  especially on tablets, we made this a double-tap rather than a  single tap. Note: based on user experience, we may optionally  bring back single tap at some point in the future as an end-user  customization.  </p></div>    </div>    <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1-3'>  <h3 id='sec-1-3'><span class='section-number-3'>1.3</span> Summary</h3>  <div id='text-1-3' class='outline-text-3'>      <p>  Android Accessibility continues to move forward with Jelly Bean,  and will continue to evolve rapidly along with the  platform. Please use the <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=http://groups.google.com/group/eyes-free&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=S90OUI28GaariAKq_4CwDA&amp;ved=0CBEQFjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHb5JYxWswxySEmj8Rz3RdZ405iOA'>Eyes-Free Google Group</a> to provide  constructive feedback on what works or doesn't work for you ---  what is most effective is to objectively describe a given use  case and your particular experience.  </p>    </div>  </div>  </div>  </div>      </div>    </div>

About a year ago, I first  started accessing my email on Android with K9-Mail — that  helped me bridge some of the accessibility gaps on the platform.  </p>  <p>  Over the last few months, our friends over in GMail Mobile have  been adding accessibility support to the GMail client on  Android. What is truly exciting is that this support is being  added to existing releases of Android including Froyo (Android  2.2) and GingerBread (Android 2.3).

To use this feature, you need to first    <i>activate</i> the TalkBack keyboard via the <i>Language and Keyboard</i>    option in the <i>Settings</i> menu. Next, customize the <i>TalkBack Keyboard</i> to taste via the <i>TalkBack Keyboard Settings</i> option     ---  here, you can customize additional features including    auditory feedback as you type. Finally, open your favorite    editing application, long-press on an edit field, and select    <i>TalkBack keyboard</i> as your default IME. Note that you need do    this only once; once the TalkBack keyboard has been made the    default, it persists across reboots.    </p>    </div>        </div>        <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1_3'>    <h3 id='sec-1_3'><span class='section-number-3'>1.3</span> Entering  Text On The Touch Screen </h3>    <div id='text-1_3' class='outline-text-3'>                <p>    <i>TalkBack keyboard</i> is an on-screen keyboard that supports touch    exploration along with synchronized spoken and auditory    feedback. This means you can now enter text when using devices    that don't sport a physical keyboard.    </p>    <p>    But wait, there's more here than meets the finger at first touch.    Once you have activated the <i>TalkBack Keyboard</i>, you can switch    the keyboard among three states by long-pressing the  volume    up/down buttons:    </p>    <dl>    <dt>Hidden</dt><dd>    The <i>TalkBack</i> keyboard is not displayed.    </dd>    <dt>Navigating</dt><dd>    You get access to an on-screen virtual D-Pad, along    with <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Back</span>, <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Home</span>, <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Search</span>, and <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Menu</span> buttons.    </dd>    <dt>Typing</dt><dd>    An on-screen <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>qwerty</span> keyboard.    </dd>    </dl>            <p>    My preferred means of using the keyboard is to turn on auditory    feedback from within <i>TalkBack Keyboard Settings</i>, as well as    having SoundBack active. In this mode, you hear keys as you    explore the keyboard along with an auditory icon; picking up your    finger types the last key you explored. Typing produces a    distinctive key-click.    </p>    <p>    The on-screen keyboard occupies the bottom 1/3 of your    screen. While entering text,  explore and find the top row, then    move above it to hear what you have typed so far.    </p>    </div>        </div>        <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1_4'>    <h3 id='sec-1_4'><span class='section-number-3'>1.4</span> Reviewing Text By Character, Word, Sentence Or Paragraph </h3>    <div id='text-1_4' class='outline-text-3'>            <p>    You can now navigate and review text by character, word, sentence    or paragraph. Use a two-finger tap to move forward through these    navigation levels; a two-finger double tap moves in the reverse    direction. Once you have selected your preferred mode of    navigation, you can use Up/Down on the physical track-ball/D-Pad,    or alternatively, flick up or down on the virtual D-Pad to move    forward or backward through the text being reviewed.    </p>    <p>    Note that text review works when the <i>TalkBack keyboard</i> is in    either/navigating/ or <i>typing mode</i>; personally, I find it less    error-prone on keyboard-less devices to first switch to    <i>navigating mode</i> when reviewing text, since it is easy to    inadvertently enter spurious text otherwise.    </p>    </div>        </div>        <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1_5'>    <h3 id='sec-1_5'><span class='section-number-3'>1.5</span> Using The On-Screen Virtual  D-Pad </h3>    <div id='text-1_5' class='outline-text-3'>            <p>    Placing the TalkBack keyboard in <i>navigating mode</i> provides an    on-screen virtual D-Pad  ---  this is especially useful on devices    that do not  have a physical D-Pad or track-ball on the front of the    device. When active, the virtual D-Pad occupies the bottom    one-third of the screen, and fast-flicks in that area has the    same effect as moving with a D-Pad or track-ball. Tapping    anywhere within the virtual D-Pad is the same as clicking with    the track-ball.    </p>    <p>    The corners of the virtual D-Pad also provides <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Back</span>, <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Home</span>,    <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Search</span> and <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>Menu</span> buttons  ---  these are especially useful on    devices that lack explicit physical or capacitive buttons for    these common Android actions. You can explore the virtual D-pad    by moving your finger around the D-Pad area; crossing the    top-edge of this area provides haptic and auditory feedback that    can be used as an orientation aid in finding the virtual buttons    on the corners.    </p>    </div>        </div>        <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1_6'>    <h3 id='sec-1_6'><span class='section-number-3'>1.6</span> Global Commands </h3>    <div id='text-1_6' class='outline-text-3'>            <p>    In addition, selecting the <i>TalkBack Keyboard</i> as your default    input method enables a set of <i>global commands</i> that can be    accessed from your physical keyboard  ---  eventually, we will make    these available via the soft keyboard as well. Here are a list of    the current commands:     </p>    <table frame='hsides' rules='groups' cellpadding='6' cellspacing='0' border='2'>    <caption/>    <colgroup><col class='left'/><col class='left'/><col class='left'/>    </colgroup>    <thead>    <tr><th class='left' scope='col'>Command</th><th class='left' scope='col'>Description</th><th class='left' scope='col'>Key</th></tr>    </thead>    <tbody>    <tr><td class='left'>Battery</td><td class='left'>Speaks the current battery level</td><td class='left'>menu + B</td></tr>    <tr><td class='left'>Time</td><td class='left'>Speaks the current date and time</td><td class='left'>menu + T</td></tr>    <tr><td class='left'>Connectivity</td><td class='left'>Speaks the connectivity state of each  connection: WiFi, 3G, etc</td><td class='left'>menu + O</td></tr>    <tr><td class='left'>Repeat</td><td class='left'>Repeats the last TalkBack utterance</td><td class='left'>menu + R</td></tr>    <tr><td class='left'>Spell</td><td class='left'>Spells the last TalkBack utterance</td><td class='left'>menu + S</td></tr>    </tbody>    </table>            <p>    These shortcuts are listed in the <i>Accessibility Preferences</i>    application where they can be edited. You can choose between    menu and search for the modifier, and any letter on the keyboard    for the letter.    </p>        </div>        </div>        <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1_7'>    <h3 id='sec-1_7'><span class='section-number-3'>1.7</span> Summary </h3>    <div id='text-1_7' class='outline-text-3'>            <p>    All of these features work on Android 2.2 and above.

<div>
<br>   $ <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>             <p>We are pushing out a series of updates via Android Market for         TalkBack and the Eyes-Free Shell. Here is a brief overview of         end-user visible changes.         </p>             <h2>Accessibility Preferences         </h2>                 <p>Going by the principle of          <em>things should just work as    expected         </em>, we have long resisted giving in to having      a complex set of user preference settings  for TalkBack and    friends --- in my experience, if you introduce such a settings    menu early on, we as software engineers tend to punt on all complex    decisions by  turning each question into a complex user-facing    dialog. That said, it is now  time to  gradually introduce    end-user settings for some aspects of  the various accessibility    tools.         </p>                     <h2>Accessibility Preferences         </h2>                 <p>Welcome new application          <em>AccessibilityPreferences         </em> to    Android.    What this application does:         </p>                 <ul>             <li>From an end-user perspective, it provides a single place    where you will find preference settings corresponding to each    accessibility tool you have installed on your phone.         </li>             <li>For developers of accessibility tools, it provides a simple    means of registering a custom program for managing end-user    preferences for that tool.         </li>             </ul>                 <p>TalkBack installs its  user preferences under this tool. You    can tweak a number of settings that affect TalkBack behavior    including:         </p>             <ul>             <li>Control whether TalkBack speaks when the screen is off ---    useful to silence status messages when you have the phone turned    off.         </li>             <li>Control whether TalkBack speaks when ringer volume is set to    0, i.e., phone is in silent mode.         </li>             <li>Control whether the proximity sensor is used to shut off    speech.         </li>             </ul>                 <p>Over time, we'll add more settings here as appropriate --- but    expect us to be conservative with respect to how many settings    show up.         </p>                     <h2>Updates To The Eyes-Free Shell         </h2>             <p>Here is a summary  of updates to the Eyes-Free Shell:         </p>             <ul>             <li>    Changes the proximity sensor logic so that it is only active when the shell is active; this should be more battery efficient         </li>             <li>Fixes a race condition bug that can trigger when the shell is being exited as an application is being installed/removed         </li>             </ul>                 <h2>TalkBack         </h2>             <p>Here is a summary of changes to TalkBack:         </p>             <ul>             <li>TalkBack now includes application-specific speech strategies    for some popular applications. This   provides context-sensitive    spoken feedback.         </li>             <li>Applications that have such speech strategies defined    include Facebook, Stitcher and GoogleVoice amongst others.         </li>             <li>Implements a settings screen that can be used with Accessibility Preferences         </li>             <li>Available settings:             <ol>              <li>Ringer Volume (Speak at all ringer volumes, No speech in Silent Mode, No speech in Vibrate and Silent Mode)         </li>              <li>Screen Status (Allow speech when screen is off, No speech when screen is off)         </li>              <li>Speak Caller ID (checked/not checked)         </li>              <li>Proximity Sensor (checked/not checked)         </li>             </ol>             </li>         </ul>                 <p>In addition, TalkBack introduces the ability to add    application-specific plugins --- expect to see more advancement    here in future releases.         </p>             <h2>AccessibilityPreferences Hints For Developers         </h2>             <p>If you're a developer of an AccessibilityService, you need    to:         </p>             <ul>             <li>Implement a preferences screen for your application.         </li>             <li> Implement this with intent filter:             <pre>            <br /><br/>            &lt;intent-filter&gt;            <br /><br/>                &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;            <br /><br/>                &lt;category android:name="android.accessibilityservice.SERVICE_SETTINGS" /&gt;            <br /><br/>            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;            <br /><br/>        <br /></pre>             </li>             </ul>             <p>Share And Enjoy,         </p>                 </div>             </div>

<div>
<br>     <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Here is a quick eyes-free access overview of the MOT Droid2. </p><h3>Hardware</h3><ol><li> The device has a pull-out keyboard, and the buttons are much    more tactile than the original Droid. </li><li>The device also has    dropped the hard-to-use D-Pad from the original Droid in favor of    PC-style arrow keys. </li>   <li>There is once again no dedicated number    row at the top. </li><li>The capacitive buttons on the front of the device appear in a different order from the original Droid --- with the device in portrait mode,  reading left to right you have: Menu, home, back,  and search.</li><li>In addition, MOT ships a voice search application on the device that is triggered by pressing a special <em>microphone button</em> -- it's worth learning the position of this key, since voice-search can be useful --- and more importantly, if you're relying on spoken feedback, hitting this button leads to the phone falling inexplicably silent.</li></ol> <h3>Software</h3> <p>If you look under accessibility, you'll find an application called Voice Readouts from MOT. This appears to be a screenreader analogous to TalkBack, though in my experience, it did not produce spoken feedback in many instances. That said, this application collaborates well with TalkBack --- and after installing TalkBack from the Android Market (note: the Droid2 does not come with TalkBack bundled) -- you can activate both TalkBack and VoiceReadout for an optimal experience.</p><p> VoiceReadout appears to have a preliminary version of touch-exploration. With VoiceReadout active, a single tap speaks the item under the finger;  a double-tap activates that item. Note that moving the finger around on the display does not appear to trigger touch exploration; also, touch exploration appears to be available in only some contexts.  </p><h4>Instances where touch exploration appears to be active</h4><ol><li> Settings application.</li><li> Portions of Android Market.</li></ol><p>In general,  touch exploration  appears to be available in ListView.</p><p>In addition, the Droid2 also includes a low-vision accessibility tool called  Zoom Mode ( look for it under Settings -&gt; Accessibility )  this tool provides a magnification lens. </p> <h3>Summary</h3><p>All in all, the Droid2 appears to be one of the better choices for eyes-free use from among the presently available crop of Android phones. Touch exploration, though preliminary, is nice to see on the platform, and the bundled low-vision magnification aid is a nice touch. Voice Readouts is also a great example of an Android accessibility service done right in that it co-exists peacefully with other screenreaders like TalkBack to provide an optimal end-user experience. To users not familiar with adaptive technologies in general, this might not sound like a big deal --- but   users of PC  screenreders have long been familiar  with the need to have only one screenreader turned on. As we transition to modern platforms like Android, it's useful to remind ourselves that screenreaders can in fact co-exist, with each tool providing something useful to create an overall experience that is greater than the sum of the parts.</p>     </div>  </div>

<div>
<br>     <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Android 2.2 (AKA FroYo) introduces many platform enhancements, and one that I find particularly relevant is the ability to plug-in additional Text-To-Speech engines. What this means from an end-user point of view:</p> <ul><li>Android comes with a set of built-in voices since Android 1.6 --- these are the <em>Pico</em> voices for English, French, Italian, German and Spanish.</li><li>With the Text-ToSpeech plug-in mechanism in place, we can now add  new engines to the platform.</li><li>The first such add-on was ESpeak, which brings support for many of the world's languages.</li><li>And now, vendors are able to sell high-quality add-on voices via  the Android Market.</li><li>Loquendo Susan is the first commercially available voice for Android. Users running FroYo can buy this voice on the Android Market. Thanks to the plug-in mechanism, once you buy a new voice, you can switch all your talking applications to  use the newly installed voice --- see instructions below.</li></ul><h2>Activating And Using   Newly Installed Voices</h2> <p> Goto  <code>Settings  → Voice Input And Output → Text To Speech Settings</code>.  First, activate the newly installed voice by clicking the corresponding checkbox item for that voice. Next, go to <code>Default Engine</code> in the <code>Text To Speech Settings</code> menu, and make the newly installed voice your default engine. Finaly, if you want all applications to use the new voice, check option <code>Always use my settings</code></p> <p>With this in place, my Nexus  and Droid both speak using Loquendo Susan --- thus turning  my Android  into  into a truly pleasant eyes-free device.</p>     </div>  </div>

<div>
<br>     <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Shortwave Radio --- and DXing  was one my hobbies growing up--- I spent many hours listening to far-off radio stations ---and in the  process developed a love for languages. Fast forward to  the late 90's, and one could now listen to radio stations from all around the world on the Internet --- but this time without  the hiss and static of shortwave propogation. But there was a catch --- you needed to be at your computer to listen to these stations.  At home, I solved this problem by setting up a set of living room speakers connected to the computer in my office-bedroom; with a wireless keyboard, this brought Internet radio to my living room. </p><p>Fast-forward to the next decade, and I  now  have the Internet in my pocket in the form of a smart phone. I recently discovered <em>Stitcher </em> on the Android Market --- and it got me the final mile to having  ubiquitous access to Internet Radio! </p><h3>Using Stitcher With TalkBack </h3><p>There is little more to say other than  <em>try it out! </em>.Stitcher on Android is a simple Android application that worksout of the box with TalkBack. Once you install stitcher fromMarket, use the arrow keys or trackball on your phone to browse through the various categories. Clicking on stations launchesplayback immediately. Note that for now, the  <em>stop </em> buttonin the player is not navigable by the trackball --- I have gotten used to hitting it by dead-reckoning since it always appears in afixed position. In the last few weeks,  <em>stitcher </em> hasreplaced  <em>StreamFuriously </em>, my previous Internet Radio solution  on Android. </p><p>So here's to happy listening!A brief note on the title of this post ---  <a href='http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1370120'>The World In My Ears </a> was also the title of abook on DXing by Arthur Cushen from New Zealand --- I remember hearing his voice in the 80's on the BBC's World Service. </p>     </div>   </div>

<div>
<br>     <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Google IO 2010 is playing home to over 5,000 attendees  in San Francisco this week. A number of Google Access engineers are at the conference consuming and producing information --- here is a brief view of some of the exciting bits seen on the Android show floor from an eyes-free perspective.</p>  <h3> Hardware And New Devices From An Eyes Free Perspective</h3> <p>Many of the phone manufacturers were showing off their latest devices on the show floor --- visit the <em>Android Sandbox</em>at Google IO  to see these first hand. Charles and I walked through the various displays Wednesday (May 19) afternoon to test drive these devices first-hand --- given the large number of Android devices coming out every week, this was  a unique opportunity to see many  of these devices for the first time. Here are some highlights:</p> <ul><li> All devices were running Android 1.6 or later,  and consequently, <em>Settings/Accessibility</em> was available on <strong>every</strong> device. Having worked on this for the last 2 years, it's extremely gratifying to see  phone manufacturers including  <em>accessibility</em> in their devices.</li><li>We found one device from Motorola  where we couldn't find the accessibility setting   --- the booth representative promised to check after we pointed this out --- waiting to hear back.</li><li>My favorite device was the LG Ally --- check this device out if you get a chance. <ul><li> Device to be sold by Verizon.</li><li>Device has an elegant tactual feel.</li><li>Front of the device sports hardware answer/hangup buttons.</li><li>The pull-out qwerty keyboard is a pleasure to use --- I would rate this one of the best designed cell phone keyboards I've seen.</li></ul></li><li>Android devices continue to show up in many shapes and sizes --- re-emphasizing that there is a device for everyone.  This makes it even more important to choose a device that meets your particular needs.</li></ul> <h3>Software --- Android Applications  Galore</h3> <p> We also visited the various vendors showing off their latest Android applications. What was gratifying was that even though most of these developers had  paid little thought to eyes-free use --- and were blissfully unaware of the existence of an Android Accessibility API, their applications worked for the most part with  Accessibility  enabled. Where there were gaps, we were able to show developers what they needed to do --- everyone was extremely receptive. Below is a brief summary of what we saw --- and a  shout-out to all the friendly developers we met:</p> <dl><dt>Where</dt><dd><p>This is a very accessible application I have been using for a while --- the developers were thrilled to hear that it was accessible since they had made no special effort.</p></dd><dt>Aloqua</dt><dd><p>A competing application to <em>Where</em> with a very slick visual UI. This application doesn't raise the appropriate Access Events at present because it's a custom UI. When we first talked to their lead developer he was extremely hesitant saying <q>I dont want to change my custom UI</q>. However,    I could hear his face light up when we said <q>You dont need to change your look and feel --- you just need to set a couple of custom Java properties </q> (specifically, property <code>ContentDescription</code></p></dd><dt>Pandora</dt><dd><p>Another favorite of mine that works well with access --- except --- the player controls are unlabeled. I showed them the application in action on my Droid --- looking forward to seeing this application become even more usable.</p></dd><dt>NPR News</dt><dd><p>There are many NPR  tools on the Android Market --- NPR News is the <em>official</em> application. The application was originally written  by a Googler and Open Sourced --- I have been using it for about 4 months and it's completely accessible. It could do with some power-user shortcut keys to make it even more efficient.</p></dd><dt>MLB At Bat</dt><dd><p> I had originally played with this application during last year's World Series; at the time, the application was  quite usable with TalkBack. I'm happy to report that nothing has regressed --- the application still continues to  to work well, except for a couple of glitches with unlabled player controls. The booth representatives had actually heard of accessibility --- and were receptive to fixing the remaining issues.</p></dd></dl> <p>Summary: The light-weight design of the Android Access layer has proven valuable in making sure that it makes it on to <strong>every device</strong>. The   minimal set of responsibilities the API  places on developers has meant that a large number of Android applications are accessible out of the box.</p>    </div>  </div>

You canbrowse by several criteria. </li><li>Books you listen to get downloaded to your device and areavailable for offline listening. </li><li>All books provide a table of contents, allowing you to jumpto a specific portion of a book. </li><li>90% of the application user interface is completelyaccessible with TalkBack --- see below for missing accessfeatures. </li></ul><p>The only glitche with using application  <em>AudioBooks </em>with the Android Access API  is that the  player controls withinthe audio-book player are presently missing  <em>contentdescriptions </em> --- this is Android-API  speak to say that thecontrols are images with missing labels.  So the first time youuse this app, you'll need someone to tell you the buttons ---alternatively just experiment to discover  theirfunctions. There are pause, play, rewind  and forward buttons ---if the friendly folk who developed this application stumble uponthis post, please get in touch, and I  can show you what you needto add to your code to make the eyes-free experience evensmoother. </p><p>Happy Listening --- And Share And Enjoy! </p>     </div>   </div>

<div>
<br>     <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>The Android Market is a treasure-trove of applications --- many of which work out of the box with Android's Access API, and as a result, the freely available screenreaders on the platform. Working with Market can be initially daunting, given the large collection applications; additionally, there are a couple of spots in the  workflow that need access improvements. While we get those fixes pushed, here is a step-by-step overview of using Android Market with TalkBack, including the work-arounds for moving over some of the afore-mentioned hurdles.</p> <h2>Android Market: A Brief Overview</h2><p>Rather than giving a detailed explanation of all of Android Market's user interface, I'll sketch my day-to-day mode of using Market ---  personally, I find task-oriented help guides far more usable.</p> <dl><dt>Task: Find Application</dt><dd><ul><li>I typically launch Android Market from within the <em>Applications</em> list in the Eyes-Free shell. On my  Droid, I typically do this with the keyboard already opened since I know I'll be typing very soon.</li><li>I press the <em>Search</em> capacitive button on the bottomright of the display to bring up the search tool. Note that Market can sometime take a few seconds to launch depending on your network --- TalkBack should announce <em>Market</em> when it's ready.</li><li>Type a search query --- as an example, try <em>audio books</em></li><li> Use the D-Pad arrow keys (up/down) to navigate the list of results. TalkBack speaks each entry as you move through the list.</li><li>Find one you like; for this example, we'll use one of my favorite Market applications --- AudioBooks from project Librivox.</li><li>Press the <em>Enter</em> key on the keyboard to open this application</li><li>This takes you to a screen that lists a short description, and comments from various users on the application. The <em>install</em> button is on the bottom of this screen.</li><li>And here comes the sticking point in the Market UI  that we're working on fixing;  when you cursor through this list, you dont always get to the <em>install</em> button.But no fear, you can still install the application!</li><li>While we work on  creating and pushing the fix for the above, I typically install applications by tapping the screen where the <em>install</em> button appears. The bad news is that Ipresently do this by dead reckoning; the good news is that the <em>install</em> button always appears at a consistent spot. The easiest way to learn to do this is to have someone put your finger on the button the first time, and then learn its position relative to the pull-out keyboard. While we know that this is not an ideal eyes-free experience, this little trick opens up a treasure-trove of applications.</li><li>Tap the <em>install</em> button, and you come to the <em>permissions</em> screen. Cursor to the <em>OK</em> button, and press <em>Enter</em> Depending on the layout of that screen, you may once again need to use dead-reckoning. At this point, I routinely click those on-screen buttons, rather than wasting time  attempting to cursor to   the button.</li><li>And voila, the <em>AudioBooks</em> application should download and install!</li></ul></dd><dt>Task: Browse Market</dt><dd><p>In addition to searching, you can also browse the Market for available applications, use the cursor keys on the D-Pad for browsing. Once selected, installing an application follows the same workflow as above.</p></dd></dl> <h2>And The Best Is Yet To Come</h2><p>Once installed, you can try out the application  by pulling down the status bar. Look for the next posting in this series for details on using  application AudioBooks --- it is one of my all time Market favorites.</p>    </div>  </div>

In a nutshell,if   you are a TalkBack user and install Eyes-Free shell, hitting   the <code>Home</code> button will bring up the eyes-free shell,   ---no configuration needed. Note that you can always get to the   default Android home screen by long-pressing the <code>Back</code> button.</p><p><strong>Share And Enjoy</strong></p>    </div>  </div>

<div>
<br>     <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>We routinely push updates to our access tools on Android; users get these updates automatically via Android Market updates. We just pushed out updated versions of TalkBack, our Open Source screenreader for Android, and Marvin, the Eyes-Free shell. Here is a brief summary of  these updates:</p> <ul><li>Android applications can now programmatically  discover if TalkBack is running, thanks to the latest changes in TalkBack. From an end-user  perspective, this means that you no longer need to configure  Eyes-Free shell via EyesFreeConfig to be the default home. If  you run TalkBack, and have EyesFree Shell installed, then pressing <em>Home</em> automatically gives you the EyesFree Shell. Remember, you can always get to the default Android Home by long-pressing <em>Back</em>.</li><li>EyesFree Shell now includes a touch-based shortcuts manager. Until now, shortcuts needed to be explicitly configured by editting an XML  file on the SDCard. With the recent EyesFree update, you can interactively define short-cuts via a touch-based ShortCuts manager. By default, we have assigned shortcut <em>1</em> to the ShortCuts manager; so to invoke this new feature, do: <ol><li>Stroke left (<em>4</em> using stroke dialer notation) to enter  the shortcuts screen.</li><li>Stroke up and to the left (<em>1</em> using stroke-dialer notation) to invoke application ShortCuts Manager.</li><li>Use the trackball/D-Pad to configure each of the 8 available shortcuts.</li></ol></li></ul> <p><strong>Marvin: We  hope this gives some minimal relief to the pain in all the diodes on your left side.</strong></p>    </div>  </div>

<div>
<br>     <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><h2>Update To Android Access: TalkBack</h2> <p>Smart phones tend to be short on physical buttons --- even devices like the G1 or MotoRola Droid have very few buttons when the physical keyboard is not open. This provides interesting challenges when designing an efficient eyes-free interface --- especially given the old maxim <em>Speech is silvern, but silence is golden!</em>.Said differently, once you have built a system that talks back, the first thing you want to build is an efficient means of silencing spoken feedback.</p> <p>Early versions of TalkBack on Android skimmed by without a stop speech button --- you basically moved from one activity to another,and the speech produced by the new activity effectively stopped ongoing spoken output. However, as we make more and more applications work seamlessly with our Access APIs, it's always been clear to us that we need a global <em>stop  speech gesture</em>! Notice that I said <em>gesture</em> --- not <em>key</em> --- stopping speech is a critical function that we'd like to enable without having to pull out the physical keyboard, and something we'd like to have devices without a physical keyboard.</p> <p>In the spirit of <em>the  dual to every access challenge is an opportunity to innovate</em>, we recently launched a new experimental TalkBack feature on devices running Android 2.0. Devices on the Android 2.0 platform have a <em>proximity sensor</em> on the top front left corner of the phone --- this is typically used to lock the screen when you're holding the phone up to your ear when on  a phone call. As the name implies, the <em>proximity sensor</em>fires when you get close to it --- you can activate it by waving your hand close to the top left corner of the phone. As an experimental feature, we have configured  the latest version of TalkBack to silence ongoing speech if you wave your hand in front of the proximity sensor.</p> <p>Note that this is a new, experimental feature --- it's something that we welcome feedback on our public <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/eyes-free/'>Eyes-Free Google Group</a>. We'd like to know if you accidentally activate <em>stop speech</em>because of this new feature. In having used it for a few weeks, I find that I am not triggering it accidentally --- but that might well be a function of how I hold the phone.</p><h2>What Devices Does This  Available On?</h2> <p>Note that at the time of writing, the devices that have a proximity sensor that I have used this on include:</p> <ul><li>MotoRola Droid from Verizon</li><li>Google NexusOne</li></ul><p>Note that the G1 and other older Android devices did not have a proximity sensor.</p>    </div>  </div>

When in <u>phonebook</u>, you get eyes-free access to your contacts with the ability to quickly move to the  contact  that you wish to call. </p><p>When in the  <u>phonebook</u>, you can  scroll through your contacts  and press the <u>call</u> button to call the <i>current</i> contact.  In addition, you can use <i>stroke dialing</i>as explained below to quickly move to a specific contact. </p> </div> <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1.1'><h3 id='sec-1.1'>1.1 Entering Letters Using Stroke dialing </h3><div id='text-1.1'>  <p>We covered eyes-free input with the touch screen in the <a href='./02-strokes.html'>earlier video on stroke dialing</a>--- in that video, we illustrated the concept via a traditional phone keypad. Here, we  extend that technique to enable   textual input.  In the explanation below, we will use compass directions  to help with orientation. As before, we will use relative positioning i.e., for the rest of this explanation, you can start <i>anywhere</i> on the touch-screen --- though we recommend (for reasons that  will become  evident) that you start somewhere close to the middle of the screen. </p></div> </div> <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1.2'><h3 id='sec-1.2'>1.2 The Eight Compass Directions</h3><div id='text-1.2'>  <p>Defining the <i>center</i> as where you first touch down on the screen, notice that  you can stroke in any one of the <u>8</u> compass directions, and that  opposite pairs of compass directions e.g., North and South, can be thought of as <i>opposites</i>. So we get <u>4</u> pairs. We enumerate these below, associate them with the <u>4</u> Google colors,  and  equate them to their equivalent strokes from the <i>stroke dialer</i>: </p> <ul><li>Red: North-West and South-east <u>1</u> and <u>9</u>. </li><li>Blue: North and South  --- <u>2</u> and <u>8</u>. </li><li>Green: North-East and South-West --- <u>3</u> and <u>7</u>. </li><li>Yellow: East and West --- <u>4</u> and <u>6</u>.  </li></ul> <p>Now, let's place the letters of the alphabet on these <u>4</u> circles as follows: </p><ul><li>Red: <u>A</u> ... <u>H</u></li><li>Blue: <u>I</u> ... <u>P</u></li><li>Green: <u>Q</u> ... <u>X</u></li><li>Yellow: <u>Y</u> ... <u>Z</u>.  </li></ul> <p>To input a given letter, we <i>stroke</i> to the circle containing the desired letter, trace along the circle till we hear the letter we want, and lift up the finger to make the selection. Letters are spoken in a female voice while moving along the selected circle; lifting up the finger speaks the selected letter in a male voice. </p><p>Notice that conceptually, we have defined a fairly simple mapping from strokes to letters of the alphabet! </p></div> </div> <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1.3'><h3 id='sec-1.3'>1.3 Skimming  The Contact List</h3><div id='text-1.3'>  <p>So to cut a long story short, you <i>dont need to</i> scroll through the contact list. To quickly jump to a contact, use the technique described above to input the first letter from the contact's name --- the aplication jumps to contacts starting with that letter. At that point, you can either scroll, or enter additional letters to further filter the contact list. </p> </div> </div> <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1.4'><h3 id='sec-1.4'>1.4 Examples Of Using Strokes For Letters</h3><div id='text-1.4'>   <p>Notice from the mapping shown earlier that we can <i>enter</i> each circle either at the <u>top</u> or <u>bottom</u>. Thus, entering the red circle at the <u>top</u> gets to <u>A</u>, while entering it at the <u>bottom</u> gets us to <u>E</u>. This means that the <u>8</u> letters on any given circle are no more than <u>3</u> steps away ---  for example, to enter <u>C</u>, one needs to trace clockwise from <u>A</u>, or counter-clockwise from <u>E</u>. As an example, <u>H</u> is only <u>1</u> step from <u>A</u> on the red circle. similarly, <u>P</u> is only <u>1</u> step from <u>I</u> on the blue circle. </p></div></div></div><div id='postamble'><p class='author'> Author: T.V Raman <a href='mailto:raman@google.com'>&lt;raman@google.com&gt;</a></p><p class='date'> Date: 2009-03-30 Mon</p><p>HTML generated by org-mode 6.08c in emacs 23</p></div>    </div>    </div>  </div>

Here is how it works --- we start with a brief description of the problem  that asks the <i>right</i>question. The answer becomes self-evident as you follow this video. </p> </div> <div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1.1'><h3 id='sec-1.1'>1.1 The Problem</h3><div id='text-1.1'>  <p>On-screen keyboards typically show some buttons on the screen that you activate by touching the screen. To activate such buttons, one needs to look at the screen, because the buttons are placed at specific points on the screen, i.e., they are <i>absolutely</i> positioned. So what if you want to activate such buttons <i>without</i> looking at the screen? From the foregoing description, it's clear that the only reason one is forced to  look at  an on-screen keyboard  is because the buttons are <i>absolutely</i> positioned. So let's relax that constraint, let's use <i>relative</i> positioning to place the buttons. </p><p>We'll start with a keyboard we're all familiar with, the telephone keypad. Since we're using relative positioning, let's place  the center of the keypad  <i>wherever</i> you  first touch the screen. So, to dial a <u>5</u>, you just touch the screen. </p><p>Now, you know where <u>5</u> is --- it's where you first touch down. But look, since you know the layout of a phone keypad, you can now find all the other digits <i>relative</i> to the <u>5</u>. So for example, <u>2</u> is directly above <u>5</u> --- so to    press <u>2</u>, you touch down on the screen, and stroke up before lifting your finger. similarly, you stroke down for an <u>8</u>, or diagonally up for a <u>1</u>. </p><p>In real life, we both <i>hear</i> and <i>feel</i> as we press physical buttons. This form of synchronized auditory and tactile feedback is essential for creating user interfaces that <i>feel</i>realistic. The stroke dialer produces a slight vibration as  the finger moves over the various buttons that is synchronized with an auditory <i>tick</i> to achieve this effect. It also produces spoken feedback to indicate the button that was pressed. </p><p>To conclude this video, let's dial a few numbers. </p></div></div></div><div id='postamble'><p class='author'> Author: T.V Raman <a href='mailto:raman@google.com'>&lt;raman@google.com&gt;</a></p>  </div>    </div>  </div>

Applications from this project can be used stand-alone; they can also be used together through the Eyes-Free shell. This collection of videos will cover the latter scenario. </p> <p>We will refer to the eyes-free shell as <i>Marvin</i> in honor of Douglas Adams' famous paranoid android ---  our Marvin says  <pre class='example'><br />Brain the size of a planet and they expect me to make phone calls?<br /></pre>The Marvin home screen  provides single-touch access to useful information via a collection of talking mini-applications. In addition,  commonly used applications can be placed under <i>shortcuts</i> for quick access. Finally, the <i>call</i> button automatically launches the eyes-free <i>Talking Dialer</i>  ---  all of these applications are covered in detail in subsequent videos. </p></div></div><div id='postamble'><p class='author'> Author: T.V Raman <a href='mailto:raman@google.com '>&lt;raman@google.com &gt;</a></p>  </div>    </div>  </div>

<div>
<br>    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>In the first article in this series, I'll cover the T-MobileG1 from HTC, my first  accessible Android.Note: I've since moved on to the MotoRola Droid, but that is fora future article in this series. </p> <p>I'll try to use a consistent outline for these articles where possible --- in general, you can expect articles covering a particular Android device have separate sections that address the hardware and software.  Note that the softwware bits --- the Eyes-Free Marvin Shell and our  free screenreader TalkBack, our common across <em>all</em> all Android devices. </p><h3>The G1  Device And Eyes-Free Use</h3><p> Here is a brief summary of my experience with the G1hardware:</p><ul><li>The G1's keyboard is easy to use once you get used to thelayout, you can effectively touch-type with two thumbs.</li><li>It is possible to do many functions without having to pullout the keyboard, thanks to the track-ball and buttons on thefront panel.</li><li>The front panel has 5  buttons and a trackball:left-to-right, these are:<em>Call</em>, <em>Home</em>, <em>Menu</em>, <em>Back</em>, and<em>Hangup</em>.</li><li>The <em>menu</em> button is something you will use very oftenwith Android applications. When you try out a new application,pressing <em>menu</em> lets you explore the application via the track-ball.</li><li>The track-ball takes some getting used to, it can move overmultiple items in lists if one isn't careful.</li><li>This was the first time I used a touch-screen, and the G1opened up many user-interface innovations.</li></ul><h3>Eyes-Free: Marvin Shell And TalkBack On G1</h3><p>The Marvin Shell is my default home shell on all my Androiddevices. Note that TalkBack works fluently with the defaulthome-shell that comes with Android; however the Marvin Shell hassome nice touches that make it ideal for efficient eyes-free use--- for examples, see <a href='http://www.youtube.com/user/EyesFreeAndroid'> YouTubechannel EyesFreeAndroid</a>.Here is a brief summary of my G1 setup, along with examples ofperforming some sample tasks. A word of caution first on whatdoesn't work yet:<strong>The browser is not yet TalkBack-enabled, and as aconsequence, browser-based applications such as GMail will notwork (yet).</strong></p><ul><li>I have option <em>accessibility</em> checked (see theAndroid settings menu). Within that same menu, I have TalkBack,SoundBack and KickBack enabled.</li><li>I also have the Eyes-Free Shell available on the AndroidMarket installed, along with the suite of Eyes-Free applicationsthat accompany it.</li><li>Pressing the <em>Home</em> button on the front panel switchesto or restarts the Eyes-Free Shell.</li><li>Many common actions can be performed by touch-gestures on theEyes-Free Shell, see the relevant <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUJnDkegsV4'>YouTube Video</a>.</li><li>You can enter Marvin's  <em>application launcher</em> bystroking down on the home screen. Once in that launcher, you canuse the <em>circle dialer</em> to quickly jump to a particularapplication; you can scroll the list with the track ball. Onceyou've found an application, you the <em>call</em> button on thefront panel to launch the application.</li><li>Here is the  <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu5FCQmtdJU'>StrokeDialer</a> for keypad input in action. As an example, I stroke<em>right</em> to get a <em>Y</em> and that selects the YouTubeapplication. Launch it by pressing <em>call</em> on the frontpanel.</li><li>When you launch the <em>YouTube</em> application, TalkBacktakes over --- as the end-user, you continue to get spokenfeedback and typically are never  aware of the transition.</li><li>Note that many Android applications use the touch screen forrapid interaction. Taking a few minutes to get oriented with thetouch controls for an application you plan to use often can make task completion more efficient. Caveat: we dont yet have an exploration widget to aid in this --- typically, I've had the user interface described to me. Notice that once you know that the YouTube   UI  uses a landscape orientation and that the bar for controling playback appears on the bottom, you can easily use your finger to  slide along the bottom of the screen to control playback.</li><li>TalkBack provides fluent spoken feedback for many commontasks, such as Instant Messaging using Google Talk, or for SMSusing the built-in Messaging application.</li><li>Another useful Android feature to leverage is the <em>StatusBar</em> --- here is where applications post notifications,e.g. a missed call, or an upcoming calendar appointment.</li><li>You <em>open up</em> status bar by <em>bringing it down</em>--- think of it as pulling down a screen. Place your finger atthe top of the screen and stroke <strong>all</strong> the waydown.</li><li>You can now use the track-ball to scroll through anyavailable notifications and hear them  spoken. This isparticularly useful with Google Calendar.</li></ul><p>And of course, there is much more to say than will fit in asingle blog article. </p>    </div>  </div>
