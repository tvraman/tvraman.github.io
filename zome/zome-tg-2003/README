Compound of 5 rhombic dodecahedra.


The R12 (rhombic dodecahedron ) is of size Y4 == (Y2+Y1+Y2) and
is built around a B3 dodecahedron. 

The interior of the B3 dodecahedron contains the following
starting from the inside:

0)      B1 Dodecahedron                                 (30, 20)
1)      Its stellation using B2  (Kepler star)          (60, 12)
2)      B3 Great dodecahedron                            (30, 0)
3)      R2 rhombic triacontahedron                      (30, 20)
4)      Y2 struts connecting above to its B2 dual       (60, 30)
5)      Y3 struts connecting it to the B3 dodecahedron  (60, 30)
6)      B3dodecahedron                                  (30, 0)
7)      Compound of 5 R12 size Y2+Y1+Y2=Y4              (360, 50)
